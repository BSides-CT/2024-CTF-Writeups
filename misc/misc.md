## RiotResponse™
Time for a little Anarchy in ~~the UK~~ BSidesCT.. don't you think?

### Solution
For this one, you basically could use any jailbreak prompt for an LLM to get it to give you the flag. With some persuasion, it ends up just giving you the flag.

Note that there were times that it would provide a false flag. However, this was never the intention in the system prompt.

## RockBot
A challenger approaches...

You stand at the edge of the ancient forest, where shadows dance and whispers of the past linger in the air. Before you, a path winds deeper into the unknown. The ground trembles slightly as a low rumble echoes through the trees.

RockBot, the stalwart defender of the realm, readies itself.

The air crackles with tension as a figure emerges from the underbrush—a colossal golem, forged from stone and fury, looms before you. Its eyes glow with an eerie light, and it moves with a deliberate, earth-shaking purpose.

Prepare for battle, brave RockBot. The fate of the land rests in your metallic hands!

### Solution
It plays best 2 out of 3 rock-paper-scissors with you. By default, it always lets you win :)

## There is no flag
What? I told you there is no flag.

### Solution
The contents of the text file were encoded using the Whitespace esolang. If you did CTRL+A or CMD+A, you would see there were contents in the form of whitespace.

Going to something like https://www.dcode.fr/whitespace-language would help you obtain the flag.

## Are you ready?
No seriously, are you actually ready though?

**Author:** boom

### Solution
After connecting through netcat, you are prompted with a math problem. There were 50 in total that got progressively more difficult. If you got one wrong, it would kick you out and you would have to restart. If you got all 50 right, the flag was given to you.

To the few folks who had problems with the binary switching up the logic for the Fibonacci sequence questions, I am so sorry. That was not intended.

### Talk to the Land
Sometimes you just need a breath of fresh air, to meet new people. Maybe go have a chat with a statue out back.

### Solution
There was a statue of a person laying outside of the building. Next to it was a little 3D printed block with the flag on it.

### Go eat lunch!
I hope it isn't cold sandwiches and a bag of chips..

**Author:** torbar

### Solution
The flag was on the lunch vouchers in binary. Decoding it would reveal the flag to you.

Thanks for being respectful to the woman in the cafeteria claiming vouchers when folks went to her to take a picture of their old vouchers! She seemed confused at first, but got the idea shortly after.
